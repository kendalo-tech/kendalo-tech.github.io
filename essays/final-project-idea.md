## Overview
Before every semester starts, students just want to know what to anticipate in their upcoming classes. Some look up their professor, some ask their friends. However, if you are a freshmen entering college or your peers have not taken the class, you be may be unprepared for what is to come. This applications allows prior students to share their experience and advice for future students taking said course.
## Mockup page ideas
* Landing page
* Page that displays all rated classes
* Page for each rated class where you can see posts
* Page where you can leave a review (must be logged in)
* User profile where you can see all the classes the user has taken

## Use case ideas
* User goes to landing page, creates a profile
* Existing user goes to landing page, looks up the specified class
* Existing user clicks on class, goes to class page
* If existing user wants to leave a review, there will be an option on the class page 

## Beyond the basics
* Email validation
* UH ID Checking
* Verify that users have taken the course
* Generate AD revenue
