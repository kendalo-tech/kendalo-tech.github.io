*Javascript is quite simply put, the best coding language I have learned (so far).*

**Javascript > Java**
Going through college, and learning languages such as Java, C, and C++, it was easy to see that coding languages were very tedious and required very precise specifications when creating variables or functions. For example, a function would require a specific return type such as void, int, or string. Everyday struggles such as having to typecast a variable from one data type to another are now gone with Javascript. 

As I started FreeCodeCamp, I expected Javascript to be your typical program with specific labels for everything. However, I was quickly proved wrong. One of the first tutorials shows you how to declare variables and I was shocked to see that you had 2 options to choose from. 'let' and 'const' were the only two keywords that you would use to define a variable. I thought it was crazy how a variable could take either an integer or a string without being specified. 

```
let pi = 3.14;
pi = '3.14';
```

Imagine how easier it is to code things now that variables are not bounded to a specific data type. In both Java and C, this snippet of code would result in an error and you would only be able to accept one datatype per variable. Javascript is a brand new learning curve as there are a lot of different features from other languages, but (to me) the quality of life features are what separates it from the other languages.

**Athletes behind screens**
Athletic software engineering is a term that I never would have thought of. The words "athletic" + "engineering" are not really thrown together much. I can see the concept behind it and I understand that practice makes perfect. Athletic software engineering diverts towards doing more things yourself so that you learn better rather than just listening to someone talk for a whole hour. This style of learning is effective but especially in the beginning weeks it will create extra stress on the students to perform to the required standard. 

**The WOD**
The dreaded, most feared, and most anticipated, the WOD. WOD stands for "workout of the day", meaning that you are required to put your newly developed skills to use. Just like any sport, you practice in order to be prepared for the actual event itself. Since WODs are timed, I feel that there will be a lot of pressure on students to feel like they need to perform. This comes with both upsides and downsides as it depends on the student. Some may feel it as extra motivation to study, while others may give up easier knowing they can not pass the upcoming WOD.
