## **Starting from Zero**

Everytime I start a new program, I stare at my computer screen with blank stare. My mind is just blank as I think to myself "What do I usually do?". After about 5 minutes of just staring, I finally decide to start writing something. In those first few lines that are written, most of it are things that you always do. In C++, including 'iostream' statement is usually written at the top. There are certain parts of code that you can just write on your own without even thinking. These are considered design patterns, the patterns we recognize when writing a famliar code. 

Understanding patterns of code is essential when solving difficult problems that use components of easier problems. Understanding the patterns of the easier problems help you understand the problem solving process for the advanced issues. Identifying patterns are devolped as you code moee and encounter the same issue multiple times. For myself, I was brand new to doing anything related to web devleopment. I would look at the code and have no idea where to start. My mind instantly hit a brick wall and I had to dig my way through it. On the other hand, my friend who has been a software developer for 4 years, can look at the same problem and immediately identify where to start and what to do. This comes through experience, the more you practice the easier it'll be when you encounter it again. Think of like playing a sport. You practice everyday to train your muscle memeory, you want to be able to make great plays without having to think about it. If you remember the correct play in practice then it'll be easier to implement it into the real game. 

I think of coding as a game, where you just have to practice if you want to improve. The more you code the better you'll be at identifying these patterns.

## **Identifying the Solution**

You may be thinking, how do I know when I have stumbled across a design pattern? The truth is you determine what becomes a pattern based on how you code and solve problems. For example lets think about how to create a number counter. There are multiple different ways you can print out the values 1 through 50 on your screen. If you were taught to use 50 print statements, then that can be considered your 'pattern'. Within my code I've used my fair share of patterns, but the biggest pattern that stands out to me observer pattern where the UI changes when data is updated on the server. As data is added into the database, we see websites reflect the changes that were made.
