## Is software constantly changing?

As I continue my journey through college, I realize that every day, things are evolving and improving. One of those things is software. Software is constantly being changed and developed for the better. A perfect example of that would be the most recently released ChatGPT. ChatGPT is an AI that can answer (almost) any question you throw at it. Of course there are limitations such as asking it personal questions, however it can basically answer anything else. It is very interesting to see how fast technology is developing and in the future technology may just take over the world!

## Why learn about software?

Software has been my main interest since entering college, and as I learn more it gets more and more enticing. Learning the skills to code something that is useful to you is one of the best feelings ever. I always wanted to understand how graphics and scripts in video games work. It is crazy to me that these games are created with the languages that we learn in classes. I grew up with games such as Pokemon, Mario, and Call of Duty. I can not even imagine how much code is involved with these games, yet I still want to know how it is done.

I hope to develop enough skills in order to create my own application or game. I strive to create a quality application that actually has some sort of use, whether it be entertainment or productivity. All it takes to become big is to create a one hit wonder application. An example I think about would be Flappy Bird. Such a simple game, but the creator made tons of money after going viral. I also hope to develop web development skills. Being able to create or edit websites sounds very satisfying. Imagine you work for a company such as Target and you design the front page of the website. The whole world gets to see the website that you contributed to.

Overall, learning these skills would greatly impact my future career. I hope to be able to accomplish my goals of creating something that I enjoy.
